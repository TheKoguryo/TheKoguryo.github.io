      <description>1.1 Regions, Availability Domains Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is hosted in Region and Availability Domain. Region is a geographical area and Availability Domain is a data center located in one region. A single Region consists of one or more Availability Domain.&#xA;Availability domains are separated from each other so that they are not affected by defects at the same time or by defects in other Availability domains.Availability Domain is designed so that it does not affect other Availability domains because it does not share resources such as power, cooling and internal networks.</description>

      <title>1.2 Fault Domains</title>

      <description>1.2 Fault Domains A Fault Domain is a grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an Availability Domain. Each Availability Domain has three Fault Domains. Fault Domains ensure that compute instances are not distributed across one physical hardware within a single Availability Domain. Hardware failures or hardware maintenance within one Fault Domain do not affect other Fault Domains.&#xA;When creating a new Compute instance, users can select a Fault Domain. If not selected by the user, the system automatically assigns them.</description>

      <description>1.3 Compartment Compartments are a folder structure that makes it easy to manage resources. When a tenancy is created, the first Root Compartment is created, and administrators can add a new Compartment as a child of the Root Compartment. All OCI resources fall into a specific Compartment and can manage the access policies of their users in units of Compartment.</description>

      <title>1.4 Virtual Cloud Network(VCN)</title>

      <description>1.4 Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) When you use OCI, one of the first things you need to do is create a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) for other cloud resources. A virtual network environment that is used by server resources in Oracle data centers, such as network address allocation, firewalls, routing rules, gateways, and so on.&#xA;If you configure the auto-created method when you first create your VCN, the following default configuration will be created:</description>

      <title>1.5 Bare Metal, Virtual Machine</title>

      <description>1.5 Bare Metal, Virtual Machine OCI offers both Bare Metal and Virtual Machine instances&#xA;Bare Metal: Provides an environment where physical servers can be dedicated to a single user. By using the resources of the physical server directly and dedicatedly, we utilize 100% of the server resources to deliver high performance. Virtual Machine: Provides a computing environment through virtualization on a physical server. By going through a layer virtualized by the hypervisor, it offers relatively lower performance than bare metal.</description>
