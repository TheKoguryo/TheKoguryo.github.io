Since OCI Request Signature is not yet natively supported, I would like to explain how to call OCI REST API using Postman&amp;rsquo;s pre-script.
To make a call through OCI Request Signature, Postman must use pre-script. Like Insomina, it does not provide plug-in functionality. Pre-script can be set in units of REST request, and can also be set in units of folders and collections.</description></item></channel></rss>
