      <description>6.1 Compartment A compartment is a logical concept that makes it easy to manage resources, and you can think of it as a folder structure. When a Tenancy is created, one Root Compartment is created for the first time, and an administrator can add a new Compartment as a child of the Root Compartment. All OCI resources belong to a specific compartment, and users&amp;rsquo; access policies can be managed in units of compartments.</description>

A policy can generally be thought of as defining what grants a user group permission to a specific type of resource belonging to a specific compartment.&#xA;Policy syntax All policies have the following syntax.&#xA;Allow &amp;lt;subject&amp;gt; to &amp;lt;verb&amp;gt; &amp;lt;resource-type&amp;gt; in &amp;lt;location&amp;gt; where &amp;lt;conditions&amp;gt; For detailed syntax, please refer to OCI Documentation.&#xA;https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policysyntax.htm&#xA;Policy General Format If the permissions for resources are defined through the policy below, all permissions are granted to the administrator when creating a tenancy, and general users and groups that do not apply a separate policy have no permissions at all.</description>
